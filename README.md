# TV Kitchen: Base

This repository contains base definitions such as interfaces, universal constants, data objects, and errors.

It is critical that great care be taken before adding code to this repository, since everything here represents coupling across the entire TV Kitchen ecosystem.

## Included in this repository
TKTKTK

## NOT included in this repository

Utilities, interface implementations (including abstract implementations), and other seemingly useful common code elements should NOT be included in this repository.

We want to minimize universal coupling. Abstract implementations specific to an architectural component should be placed in an appropriate repository depending on the nature of the element in question.
